Matt's FRC 2013 Scoring App
====
Overview
----
This application is meant to be a platform independent replacement
for the scoring half of the FIRST FRC Field Management System.
(The second half, robot control, is being designed by a friend of mine.)

I've tried to design it in such a way that will be able to use it from
year to year with as little change as possible.
We'll see how well that works out.

As of the time of this commit, I've only completed avout 1/3 of the project.
Keep an eye on the repsoitory - updates will be issued often.
Any FRC affiliation can use this software.
